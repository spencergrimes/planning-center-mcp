## Components

- `Chat`: Main chat interface
- `MessageList`: Message history display
- `MessageInput`: Message input with quick actions
- `Login/Register`: Authentication forms

## Development Notes

- WebSocket connection automatically reconnects on disconnect
- Messages support both text and JSON formatting
- Authentication uses HTTP-only cookies for security

## Deployment

Build the project and serve the `dist` folder with any static file server:

```bash
npm run build
# Serve dist/ folder
```

For production deployment, ensure:
- Update `VITE_API_URL` to your production backend
- Use HTTPS for WebSocket connections (`wss://`)
- Configure CORS on the backend for your frontend domain
